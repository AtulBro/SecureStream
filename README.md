A Cybersecurity Tool for Real-Time Download Protection
With the rise in digital data exchange, malicious files have become a growing concern for internet users. This paper introduces "SecureStream," an intelligent cybersecurity tool developed to provide real-time protection by analyzing and verifying file safety before download. 
The tool operates by intercepting file downloads, analyzing key file characteristics using trained models, and allowing or blocking downloads based on predictive analysis. This paper explores the design, implementation, and performance of SecureStream as a practical solution for real-time cybersecurity.
